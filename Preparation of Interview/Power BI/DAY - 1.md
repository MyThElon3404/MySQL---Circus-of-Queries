## 1. Calculated Columns and Measures: How do you create them in Power BI Desktop?
- Calculated Columns:
Calculated columns are computed using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and are added to your data model as new columns. They are calculated row-by-row during data load or data refresh.
You use calculated columns when you need to add a column with a calculation that will be applied to every row in a table.
